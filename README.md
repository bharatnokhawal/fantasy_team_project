HOW TO RUN ---- 
So go to main_1.py file and run so this are based on predict first run or wickets then also obsurve 4s,6s,caught,runout then predict their points.
and then main_2.py this file also predict point but all things like 4s , 6s , caught , runout all are pass in ml model then predict. 
or last one main_3.py predict run or wickets only.

then also use match_based_by_players_info.py in this check player data against team or speccific player so using this make a algorithms in 
match_based_by_players_run_predict.py file and predict fantasy team overall performace against team or their players.

with_predict_using_impact_score.py is first use machine learning model for predict run or wickets then find out impect score or then predict fantasy point team on the basis of players performace against team or team player or also impact score.

add a new combined_scores.py file for based on fantasy points against team or impact score make them or rank this players .
