HOW TO RUN ---- 
So go to main_1.py file and run so this are based on predict first run or wickets then also obsurve 4s,6s,caught,runout then predict their points.
and then main_2.py this file also predict point but all things like 4s , 6s , caught , runout all are pass in ml model then predict. 
or last one main_3.py predict run or wickets only.

then also use match_based_by_players_info.py in this check player data against team or speccific player so using this make a algorithms in 
match_based_by_players_run_predict.py file and predict fantasy team overall performace against team or their players.
